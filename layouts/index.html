          <p>Gym Rules</p>
          <p>
            <code>rule 1.</code> Work and share knowledge with the gym because
            more often than not, the crowd has someone else that has the
            knowledge you are missing, and vice versa. Nobody is better alone.

          </p>
          <p>
            <code>rule 2.</code> Don&#39;t be afraid of voicing/sharing your
            ideas, the people often need some small part of wisdom or knowledge
            from you, the community reaps what you sow.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>rule 3.</code> Humble, everyone, no matter their histories,
            has some worthy thing to contribute to a mission/cause.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>rule 4.</code> Hark work, everyone, no matter their histories,
            or their perceived notion of strength in themselves, have something
            worthy to give and contribute to a mission/cause.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>Main Mantra Against Procrastination:</code>
            Self-awareness is the bane of progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>Explanation:</code> Questions about whether this is fun?
            Whether this is productive? Whether you can do this quickly so you
            can play more? Whether this is worth it? These are irrelevant things
            to the work needed to achieve results itself. Real work happens when
            you let go of your head from self-awareness. Real work happens when
            you stop planning for things to happen. A plan is very important,
            but once a plan is manifested, let go of your self-awareness, and
            trust in the plan.
